"Currently, I am a Platzi student. One of my purposes is to learn, develop, and teach the entire universe that starts with web3 technology, from blockchain, DAO, DeFi, ReFi, NFT, IOTA, metaverses, and everything related to cryptography, AI, and the Internet of Things. I have been doing this since 2015. I analyze Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and follow the advancements in blockchain technology, including Ethereum, IOTA, Polkadot, and more. I also understand the importance of AI."
